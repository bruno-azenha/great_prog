Sometimes, we receive harsh feedback and might feel lost without knowing what to do with it.
It’s very easy to get defensive when receiving feedback, but it is more a sign of the feedback being poorly given than of a problem in the person receiving the feedback.

When I recognise myself getting defensive, I use it as a signal that I don’t quite understand the needs of the person giving the feedback and I need to turn the feedback into something more actionable. The superpower that comes into play is Curiosity!

It is time to dig a bit deeper. The answer to how to make the situation better is probably within the person/people that gave the feedback in the first place, but it is my responsibility to help them express it if they do not do it proactively.

I like to follow a little process:

1. Be thankful. They’ve taken their time to help you become a better person.
2. Find the what. Something (or many things) happened that led to negative feedback. Identify what it was so that you have a clear example to work on instead of foggy ideas.
3. Identify the feelings. My actions cause feelings in other people. I want people around me to be happy. To know that I am creating negative feelings through my actions gives me extra energy to change them.
4. Identify the needs. Negative feelings come from unfulfilled needs. What are the needs of the feedback-giver that are not being fulfilled?
5. Enlist their help. After understanding what happened, how it made them feel and what needs are not being fulfilled, ask them which action I could take to better fulfill their needs.
6. Do my best to take that action

Going through this process with someone that just gave you harsh feedback might be hard, but it is almost guaranteed to make you better understand one another and bring you closer together.
