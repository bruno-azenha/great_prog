# 100 Coaching Calls Challenge

## What is This?

I'm challenging myself to get word of my coaching business out and have 100 completely free coaching calls over three months. My deadline is the **1st of November 2022**.

Schedule a completely FREE coaching session with me. [HERE](https://practice.do/pragprog/book/challenge)


## How to know if this is for you?

- You recognize yourself as a **tech person**
- You are in a position of tech leadership or would like to be in one
- You want to create an amazing environment around you, be it at work or outside of it
- You might be going through struggles involving confidence, communication or leadership skills
- **You are ready to make change happen in your life**

## What Do You Get From Me?

A 1-hour session of life coaching focused on a topic of your choice in which I act as co-pilot and help you have life-changing insights.

## What's The Catch?

There's no catch! :) 

I'm doing my best to have a great understanding of what my clients need and how I can help them.
By talking to me and showing up fully with your strengths and struggles, you give me the information necessary to create programs and packages specially for my potential clients.

I get marketing research done and you get a free coaching conversation out of it
